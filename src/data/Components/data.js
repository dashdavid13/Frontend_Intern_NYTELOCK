Wordmark logos work really well when a company has a succinct and distinct name. Google's logo is a great example of this. The name itself is catchy and memorable so, when combined with strong typography, the logo helps create strong brand recognition.",

Each of these companies' logos is so emblematic, and each brand so established, that the mark alone is instantly recognizable.",

A few famous examples include the BP starburst-y logo, the Pepsi divided circle and the strip-y Adidas flower.",
        text2: "Like all logo symbols, abstract marks work really well because they condense your brand into a single image. However, instead of being restricted to a picture of something recognizable, abstract logos allow you to credate something truly unique to represent your brand.",
